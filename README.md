My project is a shooting game where players have to survive by killing zombies. Players can move by using 'a' and 'd', shoot with the space key, and reload by holding 'r'. As the game progresses, the zombie speed and its spawn rate will both increase, making the game more challenging. The score will also be tracked at the top left corner that sill motivate the player to keep playing, and compete for a even higher score.
